You are working on the IWRITE project.

IMPORTANT:  
Authentication, subscription plans, daily usage limits, and the seeding script are ALREADY implemented and working.  
Your own previous message said:

- dailyUsageCount and dailyUsageDate fields added
- Plan helpers in server/plans.ts
- Limit middleware in server/limitMiddleware.ts (20 daily generations for FREE)
- Middleware applied to all AI endpoints
- scripts/seedUsers.ts created
- FREE_DAILY_LIMIT, SEED_FREE_USER_EMAIL, SEED_PRO_USER_EMAIL already in use
- Remaining work: update DEPLOYMENT.md and run build/seed/dev

🎯 GOAL (VERY IMPORTANT)

1. **DO NOT rename or change any existing code, identifiers, env var names, or scripts.**  
   - Keep exactly:
     - `FREE_DAILY_LIMIT`
     - `SEED_FREE_USER_EMAIL`
     - `SEED_PRO_USER_EMAIL`
     - `npm run seed:users`
     - Plan names (`FREE`, `PRO_MONTHLY`, `PRO_YEARLY`, or any others you added)
     - `dailyUsageCount`, `dailyUsageDate`
   - Do NOT modify server/plans.ts, server/limitMiddleware.ts, scripts/seedUsers.ts, or any AI endpoints unless there is a critical bug. Assume they are correct.

2. Only do three things:
   - Update **DEPLOYMENT.md** with the missing documentation.
   - Run a final verification (build + seed + dev).
   - Summarize what you did and confirm both plans/users work.

🧩 PART 1 — DEPLOYMENT.md UPDATE (DOCS ONLY)

Open `DEPLOYMENT.md` and:

1) In the ENV table / optional variables section (around where you mentioned earlier), add three rows using the **exact names already used in the code**:

   | Variable                | Description                                      | Example                |
   |-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
   | `FREE_DAILY_LIMIT`      | Daily AI generation limit for FREE plan         | `20`                   |
   | `SEED_FREE_USER_EMAIL`  | FREE test account email used by seed:users      | `test@example.com`     |
   | `SEED_PRO_USER_EMAIL`   | PRO test account email used by seed:users       | `mhtrading@gmail.com`  |

   (If the table already exists, just append these rows in the correct place. Do NOT rename existing rows.)

2) Add a new section called exactly:

   `## 🎯 Subscription Plans & FREE Daily Limits`

   Under it, document:

   - Two-tier model:

     - **FREE Plan:** 20 AI generations per day (limit resets daily at UTC midnight).
     - **PAID Plan (PRO_MONTHLY/PRO_YEARLY):** Unlimited AI usage.

   - Seeding test accounts, explicitly referencing the existing script name and env vars, for example:

     ```bash
     npm run seed:users
     ```

     Explain that:
     - This creates or updates two users (idempotent):
       - FREE: `test@example.com` (plan FREE)
       - PRO: `mhtrading@gmail.com` (plan PRO, e.g. PRO_MONTHLY/PRO_YEARLY)
     - Passwords are set via environment variables (do NOT write passwords as plain text in the doc).

   - Testing limits:
     - Login as FREE user → hit the generation limit after 20 uses; an error message appears.
     - Login as PRO user → can generate beyond that without being blocked.

Make sure DEPLOYMENT.md remains clean and consistent; do not remove any existing content.

🧩 PART 2 — FINAL VERIFICATION (NO CODE CHANGES EXCEPT DOC)

After updating DEPLOYMENT.md, run the following commands:

1) Build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
