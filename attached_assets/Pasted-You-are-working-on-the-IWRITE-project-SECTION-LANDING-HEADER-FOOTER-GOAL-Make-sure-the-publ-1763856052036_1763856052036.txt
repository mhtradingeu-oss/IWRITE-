You are working on the IWRITE project.

SECTION: LANDING + HEADER + FOOTER

GOAL:
Make sure the public shell of the app is production-ready:
- Landing page (`/`)
- Header (top nav)
- Footer (global)
All content, actions, links, and i18n must be correct and polished.

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT change API endpoints, DB schema, or env var names.
- DO NOT change auth logic or plan logic.
- DO NOT move/remove QueryClientProvider.
- You MAY edit React components, layouts, routing, and text.

TASKS:

1) LANDING PAGE (`/`)
- Locate the Home/Landing page component (e.g. `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` or similar).
- Ensure:
  - Clear hero section: title, subtitle, two CTAs:
    - “Login / Open Workspace” → `/login`
    - “View Pricing” → `/plans` or `/settings#plans`
  - Features section describing:
    - AI Writer
    - Songwriter
    - Templates & Style Profiles
    - QA checks
    - Topics/Search
  - Multilingual section (EN/DE/AR).
  - Company/Trust section mentioning MH Trading GmbH & Crew Art.
- Verify all buttons:
  - Scroll or navigate to the correct sections/routes.
  - No 404s or dead links.

2) HEADER
- Locate the header/nav component used on the landing page.
- Ensure it has:
  - Logo/name (IWRITE).
  - Nav links:
    - Product → scroll to Features.
    - Pricing → scroll or `/plans`.
    - Login → `/login`.
  - Language switcher that reuses the existing i18n for EN/DE/AR.
- Check that:
  - Header is only shown where needed (Landing/public pages).
  - Workspace header (if any) is separate and does not conflict.

3) FOOTER
- Locate the global Footer component.
- Verify:
  - Real company info:
    - MH Trading GmbH
    - Polierweg 39, 12351 Berlin
    - HRB 274951
    - VAT ID: DE454258724

- Fix spacing:
  - No giant empty gap above footer.
  - Responsive grid: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 4 on desktop.

4) I18N
- Ensure hero headings, CTA labels, and key footer labels have EN/DE/AR translations using existing i18n.
- AR text must be RTL/right aligned in Landing.

5) VERIFY
- Run `npm run build`.
- Start dev server.
- As unauthenticated user:
  - Visit `/` and test all nav links and footer links.
  - Switch languages and ensure content updates and layout stays sane.

Summarize:
- Components/files edited.
- Fixes made to content, links, and layout.
