You are working on the IWRITE project (AI-powered document workspace by MH Trading GmbH).

Most backend logic is already implemented:
- Auth + JWT cookies
- FREE vs PRO plans and daily limits
- Admin / Super admin panel
- Billing / Stripe endpoints with “Stripe not configured” handling
- Dashboard, AI Writer, Songwriter, Documents, Templates, etc.
- Legal pages and global footer

Your job in THIS TURN is to make sure the **end-to-end UX flow** is complete and polished:

1) App opens on a strong, multilingual Home / Landing page.
2) From Home, users can log in or sign up.
3) After login, users are redirected **based on their role/plan** to the correct dashboard.
4) Pricing/Payment page is reachable, designed, and uses the existing billing logic (with a demo/test-ready UI).
5) Every important page is checked one-by-one for:
   - Design completeness
   - Content quality (EN/DE/AR)
   - Correct links and redirections
   - No 404 / dead ends

⚠️ DO NOT:
- Change API endpoints, DB schema, or env vars.
- Change plan names or roles.
- Change auth security or cookie handling.
- Move QueryClientProvider.

You MAY:
- Add/update React components, routes, redirects.
- Improve UI, labels, texts, and layout.
- Add missing pages (Home, Pricing) and wiring.

==================================================
PART 1 – HOME / LANDING PAGE AS FIRST ENTRY POINT
==================================================

1) Landing Route

- Ensure there is a **public Landing page component**, e.g. `Home.tsx`.
- Route:
  - `/` should show the Landing page for unauthenticated users.
- For authenticated users hitting `/`:
  - Either:
    - Redirect them immediately to their dashboard (see Part 3), OR
    - Show Home but with a prominent “Open Workspace” button that leads to their dashboard.
  - Choose the simpler behavior that is consistent with the existing router.

2) Landing Page Content (High-Quality, Multilingual)

Design the Home page as a professional SaaS landing page using the existing design language (dark theme, Inter, Fluent-style):

Sections (all with EN/DE/AR text):

- Hero:
  - Product name: **IWRITE**
  - Tagline (3 languages), e.g.:
    - EN: “AI-powered document workspace for regulated, multilingual content.”
    - DE: “KI-gestützter Dokumentenarbeitsplatz für rechtssichere, mehrsprachige Inhalte.”
    - AR: “مساحة كتابة ذكية بالذكاء الاصطناعي لإنشاء مستندات احترافية ومتعددة اللغات.”
  - Subtext mentioning:
    - Arabic / German / English support
    - Professional document types (contracts, policies, shop content, lyrics, etc.)
    - Developed by Crew Art, powered by MH Trading GmbH.
  - Primary CTA:
    - “Login / Open Workspace” → opens login or goes to dashboard.
  - Secondary CTA:
    - “View Pricing” → scroll to pricing or open `/plans` / `/settings#plans` based on existing implementation.

- Features grid:
  - Cards for:
    - AI Writer (documents, contracts, policies)
    - Songwriter (lyrics generation)
    - Templates & Style Profiles
    - Topics & Search
    - QA checks (medical claims, disclaimers, consistency)
  - Each card links to the corresponding **internal page**.

- Multilingual section:
  - Clearly show EN / DE / AR capabilities.
  - Short sample use-cases for each language.

- Trust / Company section:
  - “Powered by MH Trading GmbH”
  - Address, HRB, VAT (from config).
  - Clear and concise, not legal-heavy (Imprint/Privacy cover full details).

- CTA strip:
  - “Start writing with IWRITE today”
  - Button → Login/Workspace.

3) Integration with Language Toggle

- Use the app’s existing i18n / language toggle (top-right) on the Home page as well.
- Ensure:
  - EN/DE/AR text for all headings/paragraphs.
  - When AR is active:
    - Text is RTL and right-aligned.
    - Layout adjusts gracefully (no broken alignment).

==================================================
PART 2 – LOGIN FLOW FROM HOME & AUTH PAGES
==================================================

Goal: From Home → Login → correct dashboard, with no confusion.

1) Login / Auth Pages

- Ensure there is a clear way from Home to **login**:
  - A “Login” button in the header.
  - A “Login / Open Workspace” CTA in the hero.

- Clicking these should:
  - Navigate to the existing login route (do NOT create new auth endpoints).
  - If login form is already embedded in Home, make sure it still uses the correct API.

2) After Successful Login

- Once the user logs in successfully from the Home CTA or login page:
  - Do NOT leave them on the Home page.
  - Redirect them based on their **role/plan** (see Part 3).

==================================================
PART 3 – ROLE-BASED REDIRECTION AFTER LOGIN
==================================================

You already have roles and plans logically; now we ensure the routing is correct.

Consider these user “types”:

- SUPER ADMIN:
  - `role = "admin"` or similar
- PAID USER:
  - plan = PRO_* (PRO_MONTHLY / PRO_YEARLY)
- FREE USER:
  - plan = FREE (but verified account)
- USER WITH NO PLAN:
  - Created but not assigned (if supported in schema)

1) Implement a small helper on the client (no backend change) that, after `/auth/me` returns, figures out where to send the user:

Pseudo-logic:

- IF `role === "admin"`:
  - Redirect to `/admin` (or `/dashboard` first, with easy access to Admin).
- ELSE IF plan is PRO (paid):
  - Redirect to `/dashboard` (full access).
- ELSE IF plan is FREE:
  - Redirect to `/dashboard` (limited daily usage, but same UI).
- ELSE (no plan / onboarding state):
  - Redirect to a simple onboarding or pricing page:
    - e.g. `/plans` or `/settings#plans` with a banner “Choose your plan to start”.

2) Ensure this logic is applied:

- Immediately after login.
- When the app boots and finds an existing session (so refresh keeps user on appropriate place).

3) Do NOT change the backend; use existing `/auth/me` and plan fields.

==================================================
PART 4 – PRICING / PAYMENT PAGE (DEMO-READY UI)

We already have:

- Stripe billing routes
- FREE vs PRO logic
- “Stripe not configured” handling

Now we need to ensure there is a **Pricing / Payment page** that is:

- Visually complete
- Linked from Home & Settings
- Demo-ready (works with Stripe test or shows clear message when not configured)

1) Identify the existing Pricing/Plans page route:
   - e.g. `/plans` or a Plans section within Settings.

2) Polishing:

- Ensure Pricing / Plans UI:
  - Shows FREE vs PRO clearly (features, limitations, price).
  - Has “Start for Free” and “Upgrade to PRO” buttons.
  - Uses the same Stripe upgrade flow used in Settings.
- When Stripe is not configured:
  - The page should show a clean info banner:
    - “Stripe payment is not yet configured. For a demo, please contact the administrator.”
  - Upgrade buttons should not crash or hang.

3) From Home:

- “View Pricing” or “Pricing” nav link should lead users to this Pricing/Plans page.
- For logged-in users:
  - They can start upgrade from here too (same behavior as Settings).

==================================================
PART 5 – PAGE-BY-PAGE UI & CONTENT CHECK

Now do a **structured pass** through all key pages to ensure they are:

- Present
- Styled
- Have meaningful content & correct links

Pages to check:

1) Public:
   - `/` – Home/Landing (new)
   - `/legal/imprint`
   - `/legal/privacy`
   - `/legal/terms`
   - `/legal/payment`

2) Auth:
   - Login / Register route(s)

3) Workspace:
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/ai-writer`
   - `/songwriter`
   - `/documents`
   - `/file-uploads`
   - `/templates`
   - `/style-profiles`
   - `/search`
   - `/topics`
   - `/archive`
   - `/settings`
   - `/plans` (if separate)
   - `/admin`

For each page:

- Check **design**:
  - Headings, spacing, alignment are consistent with the design system.
  - No huge empty gaps or misaligned cards.

- Check **content**:
  - No placeholders like “Lorem ipsum”.
  - Text is clear and professional.
  - Where appropriate, support EN/DE/AR (especially for headings, main descriptions, and CTAs).

- Check **links / buttons**:
  - Internal navigation buttons go to valid routes (no 404).
  - “Quick Actions” on Dashboard work (Create Document, Upload Files, Manage Templates).
  - Footer links go to the right legal pages.

- Check **redirections**:
  - Unauthenticated user hitting workspace routes is redirected to login or home (not stuck).
  - Logged-in user hitting `/` is handled according to the logic in Part 3.
  - After upgrade or settings changes, user lands in a sensible place (Settings, Dashboard, etc.).

==================================================
PART 6 – FINAL VERIFICATION

After all UI & flow changes:

1) Run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
