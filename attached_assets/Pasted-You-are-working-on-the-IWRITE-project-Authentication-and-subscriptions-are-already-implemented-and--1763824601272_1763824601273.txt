You are working on the IWRITE project. Authentication and subscriptions are already implemented and verified:

- Login works with JWT cookies.
- Protected routes work (AI Writer, Songwriter, Templates, etc.).
- There is a subscription model with FREE / PRO-like tiers.

Now I want to **finalize Phase 1** of the auth + plans system with very clear behavior and concrete seed users.

🎯 GOAL

1) There should effectively be only TWO behaviors:
   - A FREE plan with a **daily usage limit**.
   - A PAID plan with **full / unlimited** usage.
2) We must have two concrete users:
   - FREE example account for testing:
     - Email: `test@example.com`
     - Password: `Test1234`
     - Plan: FREE (with daily limits)
   - PRO / paid account for the owner:
     - Email: `mhtrading@gmail.com`
     - Password: `test@123`
     - Plan: full paid plan (unlimited usage)
3) All changes must be **safe, additive, and not break any existing features**.

Do NOT redesign the app. Just refine the plans model, enforce limits, and add safe seeding.

🧩 PART 1 — PLAN MODEL & LOGIC

1) Plan Names
- You already have plan types like FREE / PRO_MONTHLY / PRO_YEARLY.
- For Phase 1 behavior, I want:

  - Any user with plan = `FREE` → **limited daily usage**.
  - Any user with plan in {`PRO_MONTHLY`, `PRO_YEARLY`, or a new `PRO_FULL`/`PAID` if you prefer} → **unlimited usage**.

- Do NOT break the existing schema. Just make the logic clear in code:
  - Create a small helper like:

    ```ts
    function isFreePlan(plan: PlanType): boolean { ... }
    function isPaidPlan(plan: PlanType): boolean { ... }
    ```

2) Usage Limit for FREE
- Implement a **daily usage counter** for AI actions (AI Writer + Songwriter).
- Suggestion (you can adapt to existing schema):

  - Add fields to the `users` table (or a separate `usage` table):
    - `daily_usage_count` (integer, default 0)
    - `daily_usage_date` (date or string yyyy-mm-dd)

- Behavior:
  - On each AI generation request (AI Writer / Songwriter):
    - Load the current user and their plan.
    - If `isPaidPlan(plan) === true` → allow unlimited, no counter needed.
    - If `isFreePlan(plan) === true`:
      - Determine “today” (in UTC or server timezone).
      - If `daily_usage_date` is null or different from today:
        - Reset `daily_usage_date` = today, `daily_usage_count` = 0.
      - If `daily_usage_count` >= FREE_DAILY_LIMIT:
        - Reject the request with a 429 or 402 status code and a clear JSON error:
          - e.g. `{ error: "FREE_DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED", message: "You have reached your free daily limit. Upgrade to the paid plan for unlimited use." }`
      - Else:
        - Increment `daily_usage_count` by 1 and proceed.

- Make the limit configurable via env var:

  - Add `FREE_DAILY_LIMIT` (e.g. default 20).
  - If not set, use a sensible default (e.g. 20 generations/day).

3) Frontend UX
- In the UI (e.g. top bar or profile menu):
  - Show the current plan: `FREE` or `PRO`.
- When an AI request is rejected due to FREE limit:
  - Display a clear toast or dialog:
    - Explain that the user hit the daily limit.
    - Suggest upgrade to the paid plan.
- This can be minimal; do not overcomplicate the design.

🧩 PART 2 — SEEDING THE TWO USERS (FREE & PAID) SAFELY

I want two specific users:

- FREE test user:
  - Email: `test@example.com`
  - Password: `Test1234`
  - Plan: `FREE`

- PAID owner user:
  - Email: `mhtrading@gmail.com`
  - Password: `test@123`
  - Plan: **paid / full plan** (choose one of your existing PRO plan types, e.g. `PRO_MONTHLY` or `PRO_FULL`).

IMPORTANT: Do NOT hardcode these passwords in the Git repo in plain text. Use environment variables for seeding.

1) Create a small **seeding script**, e.g. `scripts/seedUsers.ts`:

- Responsibilities:
  - Read env vars:
    - `SEED_FREE_USER_EMAIL` (default `test@example.com`)
    - `SEED_FREE_USER_PASSWORD` (default `Test1234`)
    - `SEED_FREE_USER_PLAN` (default `FREE`)
    - `SEED_PRO_USER_EMAIL` (default `mhtrading@gmail.com`)
    - `SEED_PRO_USER_PASSWORD` (default `test@123`)
    - `SEED_PRO_USER_PLAN` (default something like `PRO_MONTHLY` or `PRO_FULL`)
  - Connect to the existing DB client (`db`) and:
    - If a user with `SEED_FREE_USER_EMAIL` doesn’t exist, create it:
      - Hash the password with bcrypt.
      - Set the plan to FREE.
      - Initialize `daily_usage_count = 0`, `daily_usage_date = null` (or today).
    - If it exists, ensure its plan is FREE (optionally update password).
    - Same for the PRO user:
      - Ensure the plan is the paid plan (e.g. PRO_MONTHLY).
- Add a package.json script:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "seed:users": "ts-node ./scripts/seedUsers.ts"
  }
