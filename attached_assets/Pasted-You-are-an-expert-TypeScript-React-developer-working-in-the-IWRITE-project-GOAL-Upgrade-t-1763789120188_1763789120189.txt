You are an expert TypeScript + React developer working in the **IWRITE** project.

🎯 GOAL
Upgrade the **Style Profiles** feature so it becomes a powerful but simple way to control the AI’s writing style. We want more structured options (not just free text), better UX for editing, and a small preview.

Currently the "Edit Style Profile" dialog only includes:
- Profile Name
- Tone
- Voice
- Writing Guidelines (textarea)

Please implement the following improvements:

1) STYLE PROFILES LIST UI

- On the Style Profiles page:
  - Display profiles as cards (similar to Templates), each card showing:
    - Profile name
    - Use case/type (e.g., Contract, Catalog, Email)
    - Language
    - Tone
  - Still allow Edit / Delete actions on each card.
  - Keep a clear **“Create Profile”** button at the top-right.

2) EDIT STYLE PROFILE — STRUCTURED FORM

Extend the Style Profile model and Edit UI to include these fields (in addition to the existing name and guidelines):

**Basic Info:**
- `useCase` (string or enum), e.g.:
  - "Contract", "Policy", "Product Catalog", "Sales Offer", "Internal Guide", "Email", "Landing Page", "Support Chat".
- `language` and optional `region`:
  - Example values:
    - `language: "AR", region: "MSA"`
    - `language: "DE", region: "DE"`
    - `language: "EN", region: "US"` or `"UK"`.

**Tone & Voice:**
- `tone` (enum/string):
  - "very_formal", "professional", "neutral", "friendly", "energetic".
- `formalityLevel` (optional slider or select):
  - e.g. "formal" / "semi_formal" / "casual".
- `voice` (enum/string):
  - "first_person_singular"
  - "first_person_plural"
  - "third_person"
  - or a named brand voice.

**Audience & Purpose:**
- `targetAudience` (short text or dropdown):
  - E.g. "B2B wholesalers", "salon owners", "end consumers", "internal staff", "legal team".
- `purpose`:
  - "inform", "sell", "explain", "warn".

**Writing Style & Formatting:**
- `sentenceLengthPreference`:
  - "short", "medium", "long".
- `structurePreference`:
  - "bullets", "paragraphs", "mixed".
- boolean flags:
  - `allowEmojis`
  - `allowSlang`
  - `useMarketingLanguage`
  - `requireDisclaimers` (for sensitive content).

**Words & Phrases:**
- `preferredPhrases` (textarea or tag-style input):
  - Phrases the AI should try to use.
- `forbiddenPhrases` (textarea or tag-style input):
  - Phrases the AI must avoid.
- Keep the existing `writingGuidelines` textarea but label it clearly as free-form instructions.

Make sure the Edit Profile UI is grouped into sections with simple headings:
- Basic Info
- Tone & Voice
- Audience & Purpose
- Writing Style
- Words & Phrases
- Writing Guidelines

3) STYLE PREVIEW

Inside the Edit Style Profile dialog/page:

- Add a small **preview area**:
  - A button: **“Generate sample paragraph”**.
  - When clicked, call the existing AI backend (or a dedicated endpoint) with:
    - the style profile fields (tone, voice, language, etc.)
    - a fixed internal prompt such as: “Write a short sample paragraph that demonstrates this style.”
  - Display the sample text in a small card so the user can see how this profile behaves.
- This preview is purely for UX; it should not overwrite any document.

4) INTEGRATION WITH AI WRITER

- Ensure that the **AI Writer** section can:
  - Select a Style Profile from a dropdown.
  - Send the selected profile’s ID and key fields (tone, language, audience, guidelines, etc.) along with the AI request payload.
- Confirm that the AI endpoints receive and can use `styleProfileId` or the style metadata when generating content.

5) TECHNICAL NOTES

- Update TypeScript interfaces/models for Style Profiles.
- Update backend routes and database schema/migrations to store the new fields.
- Provide sensible defaults for existing profiles:
  - `useCase = "General"`
  - `language` inferred from previous usage or default app language.
  - `tone` defaulting to "professional".
- Keep all user-facing text i18n-ready (AR/EN/DE).
- Maintain a clean, simple layout; don’t overload the UI visually.

6) TEST & SUMMARY

- Test:
  - Creating a new Style Profile with all fields.
  - Editing an existing profile.
  - Generating a sample preview.
  - Using a Style Profile in the AI Writer to generate a small document.
- Then summarize:
  - What files you changed/added.
  - How to create and edit Style Profiles.
  - How to use them inside the AI Writer.

The final goal is that Style Profiles become a **reliable, easy-to-edit configuration** that consistently produces professional, on-brand documents for different use cases in IWRITE.
