You are working on the IWRITE project (AI-powered document writing workspace for MH Trading GmbH).

Back-end features (auth, plans, admin, billing, daily limits, topics, templates, etc.) are already implemented and considered correct.  
The workspace UI (Dashboard, AI Writer, Songwriter, Documents, etc.) is largely complete.

Now we need to build a **public Home / Landing Page** and do one last UI/content pass to ensure the app is production-ready from a front-end perspective.

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

- DO NOT change:
  - API endpoints
  - Database schema
  - Auth, admin, plans, or billing logic
  - QueryClientProvider setup
- You MAY:
  - Add/adjust React pages, routes, components
  - Improve text/content/labels (EN/DE/AR)
  - Tweak layout, spacing, navigation, and redirections

Goal: A polished, multilingual marketing-style Home page + consistent, finished UI across all main pages.

==================================================
PART 1 – DESIGN & IMPLEMENT THE HOME / LANDING PAGE
==================================================

1) ROUTE & ACCESS

- Create a dedicated Home / Landing Page component, e.g. `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`.
- Add a public route for it, e.g.:

  - `/` → Home (public marketing page)
  - `/app/dashboard` or `/dashboard` → internal workspace (authenticated)

- Behavior:

  - If the user is not authenticated:
    - `/` shows the Home page.
    - If they try to access workspace routes, existing auth guards apply as before.
  - If the user IS authenticated and visits `/`:
    - Either:
      - Show the Home page but with a “Go to Workspace” button, OR
      - Redirect them directly to `/dashboard`.
    - Choose the simpler option consistent with current routing.

2) HOME PAGE CONTENT & LAYOUT

Design a professional SaaS-style landing page that fits the current design system (dark theme, Fluent-inspired, Inter font, grid layout). Sections should include:

- Hero section:
  - Product name: **IWRITE**
  - Tagline, e.g.:
    - EN: “AI-powered document workspace for regulated, multilingual content.”
    - DE: “KI-gestützter Dokumentenarbeitsplatz für rechtssichere, mehrsprachige Inhalte.”
    - AR: “مساحة كتابة ذكية بالذكاء الاصطناعي لإنشاء مستندات احترافية ومتعددة اللغات.”
  - Short subheading that mentions:
    - German compliance, Arabic/German/English support
    - Powered by MH Trading GmbH, developed by Crew Art
  - Primary CTA:
    - “Open Workspace” → `/dashboard` (or current app entry)
  - Secondary CTA:
    - “View Pricing” → Pricing section on the same page or `/settings#/plans` / `/plans` route (use whatever exists).

- Key Features section (3–6 cards):
  - Examples:
    - AI Writer (documents, contracts, policies)
    - Songwriter (lyrics generation)
    - Templates & Style Profiles
    - Topics & Search across knowledge base
    - QA checks (medical claims, disclaimers, consistency)
  - Each card:
    - Title + 2–3 bullet points
    - Icon
    - “Open in app” link to the corresponding internal page.

- Multilingual / Markets section:
  - Emphasize:
    - Full support for **Arabic (RTL)**, **German**, **English**.
    - Use-case examples:
      - AR: تسويق، عقود، سياسات، محتوى متجر إلكتروني.
      - DE: Rechtstexte, AGB, Datenschutz, Produktbeschreibungen.
      - EN: Global documentation, policies, marketing copy.

- Compliance & Quality section:
  - Mention: QA checks, medical claim checks, templates, auditability.

- Company & Trust section:
  - “Powered by MH Trading GmbH”
  - Address (Polierweg 39, 12351 Berlin)
  - HRB, VAT
  - Small statement about German company, professionalism, and data handling (no need for legal deep dive; privacy page covers details).

- Call-to-Action footer strip:
  - “Start writing with IWRITE today”
  - Button → `/dashboard` or login flow.

3) MULTI-LANGUAGE TEXT (EN / DE / AR)

- The Home page must support the **same language system** as the rest of the app:
  - Use existing i18n mechanism (language toggle in top-right).
  - For each text string on the Home page, provide translations in:

    - English
    - German
    - Arabic (RTL, right-aligned when AR is active)

- Use accurate, professional wording:
  - Avoid placeholders like “Lorem ipsum” or “Coming soon”.
  - Make it sound ready for a real client.

- When Arabic is active:
  - Mirror layout direction (RTL).
  - Headings and paragraphs right-aligned.
  - Ensure CTA buttons still read well.

==================================================
PART 2 – CONNECT HOME TO EXISTING APP NAVIGATION
==================================================

1) Header / Top Navigation

- On the Home page, add a simple top nav bar with:
  - Logo / IWRITE wordmark (text is fine).
  - Links:
    - “Product” → scroll to Features section.
    - “Pricing” → scroll to pricing part or navigate to `/settings#/plans` or `/plans` (whatever exists).
    - “Login” / “Open Workspace” → `/dashboard`.
  - Language switcher (re-use existing language toggle component if available).

2) Footer Integration

- Ensure the existing global footer:
  - Appears on the Home page as well.
  - Shows company info, legal links, and “Developed by Crew Art · Powered by MH Trading GmbH”.
- Check that:
  - Footer links (Imprint, Privacy, Terms, Payment) also work correctly from the Home page.

==================================================
PART 3 – PRICING / PLANS UI TOUCH-UP (FRONTEND ONLY)

We already have plans logic (FREE vs PRO) and admin control. Now we just need UI consistency.

1) Ensure there is a visible way from the Home page to view pricing:
   - Either:
     - A pricing section on the Home page (cards for FREE vs PRO).
     - Or a clear link / button to an existing Plans page (`/plans`).

2) Pricing section (if implemented on Home page):

   - Show at least:
     - FREE plan (limited daily AI generations)
     - PRO plan (14.99 €/month) and optionally yearly.
   - Emphasize:
     - FREE has daily limits.
     - PRO has unlimited AI usage and priority support.
   - Buttons:
     - FREE: “Start for free” → `/dashboard` or login.
     - PRO: “Upgrade to PRO” → existing upgrade flow (same as in Settings).

3) Do NOT implement new billing logic; reuse existing upgrade endpoints and UI states.

==================================================
PART 4 – UI / CONTENT QUALITY PASS ON EXISTING PAGES

After adding the Home page, do a quick **UI/content pass** across these pages:

- Dashboard
- AI Writer
- Songwriter
- Documents
- File Uploads
- Templates
- Style Profiles
- Search
- Topics
- Archive
- Settings
- Admin
- Legal pages (Imprint, Privacy, Terms, Payment)

For each page:

1) Check headings and empty-state messages:
   - Replace any placeholders (“Lorem Ipsum”, “No data yet” with no guidance) with clear, professional text.
   - For example:
     - “No documents yet. Create your first document with the AI Writer.”
   - Provide EN/DE/AR translations where appropriate (reuse current i18n approach).

2) Verify navigation:
   - All sidebar links go to the correct pages (no 404).
   - Footer links open the right legal pages.
   - “Quick Actions” on Dashboard navigate correctly (Create document, Upload files, Manage templates).

3) Visual consistency:
   - Use consistent heading sizes and spacing across pages (match design system).
   - Avoid huge empty gaps or misaligned cards.
   - Ensure dark theme colors match the rest of the app.

Do NOT introduce new features; just polish wording, alignment, and UX.

==================================================
PART 5 – VERIFICATION (UI & NAVIGATION ONLY)

After implementing the Home page and polishing UI:

1) Run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
