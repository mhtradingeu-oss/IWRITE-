You are an expert TypeScript + React developer working in the **IWRITE** project.

🎯 GOAL
Redesign and improve the **Templates** UI (list, edit, and preview) to be simpler, clearer, and more visual, while reusing the existing design system.

Currently, the template editing is done in a centered modal with basic fields (template name, header, footer, logo URL, colors). I want this to become a more powerful and user-friendly interface with a live preview.

Please do the following:

1) TEMPLATE LIST PAGE
- Keep using the existing navigation/layout shell.
- On the Templates page:
  - Display templates as **cards in a responsive grid** instead of only a simple list.
  - Each card should show:
    - Template name
    - Small logo thumbnail (if available)
    - Primary/Secondary color dots
    - A short snippet of header/footer (truncated)
  - Actions:
    - “Edit” (primary)
    - “Duplicate” (secondary, optional)
    - “Delete” (icon or menu)
  - Keep the existing “Create Template” button, but align it clearly at the top-right of the page.

2) EDIT TEMPLATE UI — SPLIT VIEW WITH LIVE PREVIEW
Replace the existing centered modal with a **full-page or drawer-based edit view** using a split layout:

- Layout:
  - **Left (or right) panel**: Template edit form.
  - **Opposite panel**: Live preview of the template as a document card.

FORM PANEL (Edit Template):
- Fields (reuse existing data model):
  - Template Name (input)
  - Header (textarea with helper text, optional)
  - Footer (textarea with helper text, optional)
  - Logo:
    - Main control: “Upload Logo” button (file upload).
    - Secondary option: “Use logo URL” text input for advanced users.
    - Show a small thumbnail of the current logo (from file or URL).
  - Colors:
    - Primary color: color picker + HEX text input.
    - Secondary color: color picker + HEX text input.
- Validation:
  - Highlight missing name.
  - Show a small inline message if the logo URL is invalid or image fails to load.
- Actions:
  - Primary button: “Save” or “Update”.
  - Secondary: “Cancel” or “Back to Templates”.
  - Make sure pressing Enter in the form does not accidentally close the whole UI if using a drawer.

PREVIEW PANEL (Live Preview):
- Render a template preview that looks like a mini document:
  - Top area with logo on one side and header text.
  - Body with dummy text (e.g. “Sample document content…”) using the selected colors for titles.
  - Footer area showing the footer text in a smaller font.
- The preview must update live (debounced) when:
  - Header/footer text changes.
  - Colors change.
  - Logo changes.
- Use the same typography and design tokens as the main app (Fluent-inspired, dark/light mode aware).
- Make sure RTL is supported:
  - When the app is in Arabic mode, mirror alignment and ensure header/footer text is right-aligned in the preview.

3) TEMPLATE CREATION FLOW
- When creating a new template:
  - Open the same edit view (split view) initialized with:
    - A generic placeholder logo (if none)
    - Default brand-like colors.
  - Allow the user to directly see changes in the preview as they type.

4) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Reuse existing API and data models for templates.
- If you introduce file upload for logos:
  - Integrate it with the existing upload mechanism (used elsewhere in IWRITE) if possible.
  - Otherwise, create a minimal endpoint or client-side storage solution consistent with the current architecture.
- Maintain TypeScript types — avoid `any`.
- Keep all user-facing text i18n-ready (AR/EN/DE).
- Respect the existing dark-mode styling (if present).

5) POLISH & TESTING
- Ensure the new Templates UI:
  - works with small and large numbers of templates,
  - handles “no templates yet” with a friendly empty state,
  - shows clear success/error toasts on save/delete.
- Test:
  - Creating a new template.
  - Editing an existing template.
  - Checking that a generated document can still select and use templates as before.

Finally, summarize:
- Which files you changed/added.
- How to open and use the new Templates UI in IWRITE.
