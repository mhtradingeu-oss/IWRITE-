You are working on the IWRITE project.

SECTION: DOCUMENTS + FILE UPLOADS + TEMPLATES + STYLE PROFILES

GOAL:
Ensure that all content-management tools fully support:
- Listing
- Creating
- Editing
- Saving
- Deleting (if allowed)
- Linking with AI tools where relevant
for both FREE and PRO users (with gating where needed).

TASKS:

1) DOCUMENTS PAGE
- Confirm:
  - API call to list user documents.
  - UI:
    - Table or cards showing title, language, type, createdAt.
    - Search box (by title).
    - Filters (by language or type if available).
    - “New Document” button:
      - Navigates to `/ai-writer` with an empty prompt.
  - On row click:
    - Open document viewer/editor.
  - In editor:
    - Ensure changes can be saved via existing API.
    - Provide “Save” button with loading and success/error states.
- Empty state:
  - When no documents:
    - Show message like:
      - “No documents yet. Use AI Writer to create your first document.”
    - CTA to `/ai-writer`.

2) FILE UPLOADS
- Ensure:
  - Drag-and-drop or file input is working.
  - Allowed file types: PDF, DOCX, CSV, XLSX, images (as originally defined).
  - After upload:
    - List shows filename, type, size, status.
    - Optionally link to which documents that file is used in (if available).
  - Deleting or removing file uses correct API and confirms with the user.

3) TEMPLATES (PRO-focused)
- For PRO users:
  - List of templates:
    - Name, language, type (e.g. “Contract”, “Invoice”).
    - Actions: View, Edit, Delete.
  - “Create Template”:
    - Template name.
    - Header / footer fields.
    - Logo upload/URL.
    - Brand colors.
  - Preview panel showing how a document would look with this template.
  - Make sure Save/Update calls correct API and shows toasts.

- For FREE users:
  - Show either:
    - Read-only templates, or
    - Upsell card: “Template customization is available on PRO plan.”

4) STYLE PROFILES
- Check Style Profiles page:
  - List of profiles:
    - Name (e.g., “Contract – Professional, neutral”)
    - Tone
    - Voice
  - “Create Profile”:
    - Name
    - Tone dropdown
    - Voice dropdown
    - Guidelines textarea
  - Ensure:
    - Save and edit calls correct API.
    - Profiles can be applied in AI Writer.

5) INTEGRATION
- In AI Writer:
  - Ensure it can use Templates and Style Profiles:
    - Dropdowns to select template + style profile (if allowed for current plan).
- For FREE:
  - Template/Style selection might be limited or partially available (according to your gating design).

6) VERIFY
- As PRO:
  - Create template, style profile, document; reload and ensure all persist.
- As FREE:
  - Ensure templates/advanced features respect gating and don’t break.

Summarize:
- Changes under Documents, File Uploads, Templates, Style Profiles.
- Confirmed flows: create/edit/save/delete + integration with AI Writer.
