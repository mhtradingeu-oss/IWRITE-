You are working on the IWRITE project.

Current status:

- Phase 1 (Auth + Plans + Daily Limits + Seeding + Docs) is complete and stable.
- Login works (JWT cookies).
- FREE and PRO users exist (test@example.com, mhtrading@gmail.com).
- The main workspace (Dashboard, AI Writer, Songwriter, Templates, Topics, etc.) works correctly.
- However, when I click on the **Settings** entry in the sidebar, nothing happens and no Account / Profile UI is visible.

🎯 GOAL

Carefully implement and wire a working **Settings / Account** page, using the existing project structure and naming, WITHOUT breaking any existing features or duplicating routes.

The Settings area should:

- Open when the user clicks "Settings" in the sidebar.
- Show the current user’s basic info (email, name, plan).
- Allow editing basic profile fields (if possible).
- Show plan & daily usage info (FREE vs PRO, limit usage).
- Integrate cleanly with existing auth and React Query.

DO THIS CAREFULLY:

- Reuse existing names, components, hooks, and patterns where possible.
- Do NOT rename or remove existing routes, components, or env vars.
- Do NOT break any part of the current app shell or navigation.

---

🧩 PART 1 — DISCOVER THE EXISTING SETTINGS HOOK POINTS

1) Scan the client code:

   - Look for:
     - Sidebar configuration (where "Settings" menu item is defined).
     - Any existing `Settings` or `Account` page component (e.g. `SettingsPage.tsx`, `AccountPage.tsx`, etc.).
     - Existing routes using React Router (or whatever router is used).

2) Determine:

   - What route (path) is supposed to be used for Settings (e.g. `/settings`, `/account`, etc.).
   - Whether there is already a component for that route, or if it's missing.

Do NOT create new route names if there is already a planned one. Reuse the intended path and names.

---

🧩 PART 2 — WIRE THE SETTINGS ROUTE IN THE ROUTER

1) If a Settings route already exists:

   - Make sure the "Settings" sidebar item actually navigates to it:
     - It should use the same path as defined in the router.
     - Clicking Settings should update the URL and render the Settings component.

2) If a Settings route does NOT exist:

   - Add a single route (e.g. `/settings`) in the main router configuration.
   - Connect the existing "Settings" sidebar item to this new route.

3) Ensure:

   - The route is **protected by auth** (only accessible when logged in).
   - The route renders inside the main app layout (same layout as Dashboard).

---

🧩 PART 3 — IMPLEMENT THE SETTINGS / ACCOUNT PAGE

If there is no proper page yet, implement a **single Account Settings page** with 2–3 clear sections.

Use the same design language as the rest of the app (dark Fluent-like, cards, etc.), and reuse existing UI components if available.

The page should:

1) Fetch current user data:

   - Use React Query (`useQuery`) to call the existing `/auth/me` or `/api/account/me`-type endpoint (whichever already exists).
   - From that response, display:
     - Email (read-only)
     - Plan (FREE or PRO_*)
     - If available: full_name, preferred_language, daily usage counters.

2) Basic Profile Section:

   - Show:
     - Full Name (editable if supported in the backend).
     - Email (read-only).
     - Preferred Language (if available from the backend).
   - If there is already an endpoint like `PUT /api/account/profile`, reuse it.
   - If not, either:
     - Implement it minimally on the server (reusing `db` and auth middleware), OR
     - Make the profile section read-only for now and clearly mark fields as not editable.

3) Plan & Usage Section:

   - Show:
     - Current Plan (FREE vs PRO_MONTHLY/PRO_YEARLY/etc).
     - For FREE users:
       - “Daily usage: X / FREE_DAILY_LIMIT today”
       - Short note: “Upgrade to PRO for unlimited usage” (text only; no full billing integration needed).
     - For PRO users:
       - “Plan: PRO (Full access)” or similar.

   - Use the fields already present in the user table (`dailyUsageCount`, `dailyUsageDate`, plan fields).
   - Use `FREE_DAILY_LIMIT` from the config (if exposed) or hard-code the value from config if needed.

4) Security Section (Optional, if endpoints already exist):

   - If there is a `PUT /api/account/password` endpoint:
     - Add a simple form for changing password (current, new, confirm).
   - If not implemented yet:
     - It is okay to leave this section as a “coming soon” area or skip it entirely.

5) Layout:

   - Use a clear structure, for example:
     - Card 1: Profile
     - Card 2: Plan & Usage
     - (Optional) Card 3: Security
   - Respect RTL/LTR layouts depending on current language.

🧩 PART 4 — INTEGRATION & NO-DAMAGE GUARANTEES

While making changes:

1) Do NOT:

   - Rename existing components or routes.
   - Remove or change behavior of Dashboard, AI Writer, Songwriter, Templates, Style Profiles, Topics, or Archive.
   - Modify the auth flow (login redirect, cookies, etc.).

2) Reuse:

   - Existing layout shell and shared components.
   - Existing hooks for API calls if they already exist.

If you need to create new files, keep them under logical locations like:

- `client/src/pages/Settings.tsx`
- `client/src/components/settings/AccountSection.tsx` etc.

---

🧩 PART 5 — VERIFICATION (VERY IMPORTANT)

After wiring the Settings page:

1) Run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
