You are working on the IWRITE project.

The app is now functionally complete:
- Auth + FREE/PRO plans + daily limits + seeding ✔
- Settings + Plans + Upgrade (with “Stripe not configured” graceful handling) ✔
- Admin panel (/admin) with protected /api/admin/* routes ✔
- Stripe billing routes and docs exist ✔
- DEPLOYMENT.md is up to date ✔

Now we want to finalize the **official branding and legal setup** for production, using MH Trading GmbH as the operating company and Crew Art as the development studio.

🎯 GOALS

1) Centralize company metadata (name, address, VAT, IBAN, BIC, etc.) in config/env.
2) Add a global footer and “About” mentions:
   - “Developed by Crew Art · Powered by MH Trading GmbH”.
3) Add official legal pages (Imprint/Legal Notice, Terms, Privacy, Payment Policy) and link them in the UI.
4) Ensure templates (document headers/footers) can use the same company details.
5) Run a verification pass (build + health + navigation) to ensure nothing breaks.

Do NOT change core auth/plans/admin/billing logic. Only extend for branding & legal pages.

🧩 PART 1 — COMPANY METADATA CONFIG

1) In the server config (or a shared config module), define company-related environment variables (or confirm they exist):

   - `COMPANY_NAME`
   - `COMPANY_BRAND_LINE` (e.g. "Developed by Crew Art · Powered by MH Trading GmbH")
   - `COMPANY_ADDRESS_LINE1`
   - `COMPANY_ADDRESS_LINE2`
   - `COMPANY_REG_ID`
   - `COMPANY_VAT_ID`
   - `COMPANY_PHONE`
   - `COMPANY_EMAIL`
   - `COMPANY_IBAN`
   - `COMPANY_BIC`

2) Expose a safe subset of these to the frontend via an existing config API or a small new endpoint, e.g.:

   - `GET /api/public/company-info`
     - Returns only non-sensitive fields:
       - name, brandLine, address lines, regId, vatId, phone, email.
     - DO NOT expose IBAN/BIC here unless really needed on the frontend.

3) On the server side, keep IBAN/BIC available for documents or invoices, but don’t leak secrets in logs.

---

🧩 PART 2 — GLOBAL FOOTER & ABOUT BRANDING

1) Create or update a shared layout/footer component on the client, e.g.:

   - `client/src/components/AppFooter.tsx`

2) The footer should include:

   - Copyright line:
     - `© {currentYear} {COMPANY_NAME}. All rights reserved.`
   - Branding line:
     - `Developed by Crew Art · Powered by MH Trading GmbH` (or using COMPANY_BRAND_LINE).
   - Links to legal pages:
     - Terms of Use
     - Privacy Policy
     - Imprint / Legal Notice
     - Payment & Refund Policy

3) Integrate this footer into the main app layout so it appears on all authenticated pages (Dashboard, Settings, Admin, etc.), respecting the existing design (dark theme, spacing).

4) Add a small “About” section:

   - Either:
     - In Settings (e.g. a card “About IWRITE”), or
     - On the Dashboard sidebar.
   - Content:
     - Short line about the product:
       - “IWRITE is developed by Crew Art and powered by MH Trading GmbH.”
     - Link to Imprint.

---

🧩 PART 3 — LEGAL PAGES (ROUTES + CONTENT)

1) Create four new pages under `client/src/pages/legal/` (or similar):

   - `Imprint.tsx` or `LegalNotice.tsx`
   - `Terms.tsx`
   - `Privacy.tsx`
   - `PaymentPolicy.tsx` (or `BillingPolicy.tsx`)

2) Register routes for them, e.g.:

   - `/legal/imprint`
   - `/legal/terms`
   - `/legal/privacy`
   - `/legal/payment`

3) Page content:

   - Use company metadata in each page (loaded from the public company-info endpoint or a shared config):

     - Imprint:
       - Company name
       - Full address
       - Phone
       - Email
       - HRB/Reg ID
       - VAT ID
       - Optional: Responsible person, etc.

     - Terms:
       - A structured placeholder Terms of Service:
         - Sections: Scope, Use of Service, Accounts, Payments & Subscriptions, Liability, Governing Law, Contact.
         - Do not claim to be legal advice; add a note that this template should be reviewed by a legal professional.

     - Privacy:
       - Structured placeholder privacy policy:
         - Data collected, purposes, legal basis, retention, rights (access, deletion), contact.
         - Note that this is a template and must be reviewed legally.

     - Payment & Refund:
       - Explain:
         - Subscriptions are handled via Stripe.
         - Charging interval (monthly/yearly).
         - Cancellation policy and renewal behavior (as currently implemented).
         - Contact details for billing inquiries.
         - Clearly state that exact terms depend on Stripe integration and should be legally reviewed.

   - KEEP CONTENT GENERIC AND MARKED AS “Template / To be reviewed by legal counsel”.
   - Use the Fluent-like UI (cards, headings, spacing) for consistency.

4) Link these pages:

   - From the global footer (see Part 2).
   - Optionally from Settings → Subscription / Billing section (link to Payment Policy).

---

🧩 PART 4 — TEMPLATES & DOCUMENT FOOTERS

1) Inspect the existing templates system (e.g. `Templates` in the client and any server-side template config).

2) For the **MH Trading** main template(s):

   - Ensure the template footer includes:

     - `{COMPANY_NAME}`
     - `{COMPANY_ADDRESS_LINE1}, {COMPANY_ADDRESS_LINE2}`
     - `{COMPANY_EMAIL} · {COMPANY_PHONE}`
     - Optional: `HRB {COMPANY_REG_ID} · VAT {COMPANY_VAT_ID}`

   - If possible, use variables / placeholders so if COMPANY_* changes, templates update automatically (not hard-coded strings).

3) Verify that existing templates for other clients (if any) are not broken by these changes.

🧩 PART 5 — VERIFICATION & REGRESSION CHECK

After implementing the above:

1) Run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
