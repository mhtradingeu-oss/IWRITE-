You are working on the IWRITE project.

The app is now failing on the client with this runtime error:

  [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one

The stack trace points to `client/src/App.tsx` where we are calling:

  const { data: user, isLoading } = useQuery({ queryKey: ['/auth/me'], ... });

This means React Query is being used, but there is no `<QueryClientProvider>` wrapping the React tree.

I want you to FIX this in a minimal, clean way, **without breaking anything else**.

Please do the following:

1) Locate the main React entry file (for example `client/src/main.tsx` or `client/src/index.tsx`).
   - If a `QueryClientProvider` is already present somewhere, verify it wraps the `<App />` (or the Router) at the top level.
   - If there is NO QueryClient at all:
     - Import `QueryClient` and `QueryClientProvider` from `@tanstack/react-query`.
     - Create a single `const queryClient = new QueryClient();`.
     - Wrap the `<App />` (or the main Router component) with:

       <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
         <App />
       </QueryClientProvider>

2) Make sure:
   - There is exactly ONE `QueryClientProvider` at the root of the app.
   - Do NOT create nested or duplicated providers around App unless absolutely necessary.
   - Do NOT remove or change any existing providers (such as Router, Theme, etc.) except to wrap them cleanly inside the QueryClientProvider (or vice versa), following current project structure.

3) After updating the entry file:
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure the client builds correctly.
   - Start the dev server (or `NODE_ENV=production npm run start` if appropriate).
   - Open the app and verify that:
     - The previous runtime error “No QueryClient set” no longer appears.
     - The `/auth/me` query in `App.tsx` works without crashing.

4) Finally, summarize:
   - Which file(s) you changed.
   - How you wired `QueryClientProvider`.
   - The result of the build and the test (confirm the error is gone).

Do NOT touch the new auth or subscription logic beyond what is necessary to fix this React Query provider issue.
