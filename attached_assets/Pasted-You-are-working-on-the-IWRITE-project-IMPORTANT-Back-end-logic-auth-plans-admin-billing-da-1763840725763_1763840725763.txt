You are working on the IWRITE project.

IMPORTANT:  
Back-end logic, auth, plans, admin, billing, daily limits, and database are already implemented and considered correct.  
Your task in this turn is **ONLY** to fix and polish the **UI layer**:

- Routes & pages
- Navigation (sidebar, header, footer)
- Click behavior and redirections
- Loading/empty/error states in the UI

You MUST NOT:
- Change API endpoints, DB schema, or env var names
- Change auth logic, plan logic, admin logic, or billing logic
- Move or modify QueryClientProvider setup
- Remove existing security checks

You MAY:
- Edit React components, routes, and client-side navigation
- Add/adjust UI state (loading, error banners, disabled buttons)
- Fix imports and page registrations
- Adjust text, labels, icons, and layout for clarity

The goal is to make the entire UI **feel complete, consistent, and free of 404s or dead links.**

--------------------------------------------------
PART 1 – ROUTES & PAGES (NO 404s)
--------------------------------------------------

1) Find the main client routing setup:
   - `client/src/App.tsx` and any router config files
   - The main layout that renders sidebar + content + footer

2) Ensure that the following paths are defined and mapped to valid React page components (no 404):

   Workspace / Product:
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/ai-writer`
   - `/songwriter`
   - `/documents`
   - `/file-uploads`
   - `/templates`
   - `/style-profiles`
   - `/search`
   - `/topics`
   - `/archive`
   - `/settings`
   - `/admin` (route exists; access control is handled on backend)

   Legal:
   - `/legal/imprint`
   - `/legal/privacy`
   - `/legal/terms`
   - `/legal/payment`

   Billing / Upgrade:
   - `/upgrade/success` (or whatever success route exists)

3) Make sure:
   - The **404 / NotFound** component is only used as a catch-all route (e.g. `path="*"`), and does not override valid routes.
   - The root `/` route:
     - After auth, redirects to a real page (e.g. `/dashboard`).

4) If any of the above pages are missing:
   - Create simple React pages for them with basic headings and layout consistent with the rest of the app.
   - Use existing design tokens / components (cards, headings, sections).
