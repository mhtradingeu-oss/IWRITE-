You are an expert full-stack TypeScript + React + PostgreSQL engineer working in this Replit project.

🎯 GOAL
Perform a **deep, clean rename of the app brand** from:

- Old name: **HAIROTICMEN Writer**
- New name: **IWRITE**

…across the UI, metadata, and docs, while keeping:
- Existing sections (AI Writer, Songwriter, Documents, Templates, Style Profiles, Search, Topics, Archive, Settings).
- Existing brand templates such as “HAIROTICMEN” or “MH Trading UG” (these are customer templates and MUST NOT be renamed).

The new app should look and feel like a generic, professional product called **IWRITE**, not “HAIROTICMEN Writer”.

🧩 STEP 1 — DISCOVERY

1. Search the codebase for:
   - `HAIROTICMEN Writer`
   - `HAIROTICMEN` in layout/header titles
   - Any `<title>` tags or metadata using the old app name.
2. Identify all places where the **app shell / workspace name** is set:
   - Top-left brand/title in the sidebar (“HAIROTICMEN Writer” in the screenshot).
   - Browser tab title.
   - Any “Welcome to HAIROTICMEN Writer” texts.
   - README / replit.md branding.
3. Distinguish between:
   - APP BRANDING → should become **IWRITE**.
   - BUSINESS CONTENT (templates, example documents, product docs) → can still use “HAIROTICMEN” where relevant.

🧩 STEP 2 — RENAME APP BRANDING

Apply the following rules:

1) **Sidebar / Layout Shell**
   - Change the app title in the top left of the workspace from:
     - “HAIROTICMEN Writer”
     → to:
     - **“IWRITE”**
   - If there is a subtitle/description under the title:
     - Make it something like:
       - “AI Document & Content Workspace”
       - Keep it short and professional.

2) **Page Titles & Headings**
   - If any pages include the old name in their main heading or subtitle (e.g. “HAIROTICMEN Writer – Dashboard”), update them to:
     - “IWRITE – Dashboard”
     - or simply “Dashboard”.

3) **HTML `<title>` / Metadata**
   - Update the main HTML title to:
     - `IWRITE – AI Document & Content Workspace`
   - Update Open Graph / SEO metadata where applicable:
     - App name → “IWRITE”.
     - Description: a concise sentence such as:
       - “IWRITE is an AI-powered, multi-language workspace for documents, templates, and songwriting.”

4) **README / Docs / replit.md**
   - Replace references to “HAIROTICMEN Writer” as the app name with **IWRITE**.
   - Where the context is specifically about the HAIROTICMEN customer brand (e.g. templates, example docs), keep “HAIROTICMEN” as a **client/brand example**, not as the platform name.
   - Ensure the README introduction clearly states:
     - “IWRITE is an AI-powered document, template, and songwriting workspace with multi-language support.”

5) **Environment / Config Names**
   - If there are environment variables or config keys like `HAIROTICMEN_WRITER_*`, consider:
     - Either keeping them for backward compatibility, **or**
     - Renaming them to `IWRITE_*` and updating all usages.
   - If you rename env keys, document the changes in README (migration note).

🧩 STEP 3 — PRESERVE CLIENT BRANDS & TEMPLATES

VERY IMPORTANT:

- Do **NOT** rename:
  - Template names containing “HAIROTICMEN” or “MH Trading UG”.
  - Example documents that describe HAIROTICMEN products.
  - Any hard-coded text that is clearly part of business content (e.g. in PDF/Doc examples).
- Only change:
  - App chrome (sidebar title, headers, meta, docs that refer to the platform name).

🧩 STEP 4 — POLISH UI COPY

While you are touching the UI strings, quickly improve major labels to feel like a polished product:

- App title: `IWRITE`
- AI Writer subtitle (under page title):
  - “Professional document creation with AI assistance”
- Songwriter subtitle:
  - “Craft original song lyrics with AI guidance”
- Dashboard subtitle:
  - “Overview of your projects, documents, and recent activity”

Make sure all user-facing text remains i18n-ready (AR/EN/DE). If there is a translation system in place, route the new strings through it.

🧩 STEP 5 — TEST

1. Run the app in dev.
2. Check:
   - Sidebar top-left: shows **IWRITE** instead of “HAIROTICMEN Writer”.
   - Browser tab title uses IWRITE.
   - AI Writer, Songwriter, Templates, Style Profiles, Search, Topics, Archive all load without errors.
   - Templates that mention “HAIROTICMEN” still show correctly (as client content).
3. Scan visually to ensure there are no leftover “HAIROTICMEN Writer” labels in the shell or headings.

🧩 STEP 6 — SUMMARY

At the end, provide a brief summary:

- Files changed for branding (layout, metadata, README, config).
- Any env/config renames performed and how to update them.
- A confirmation that:
  - The app brand is now **IWRITE**.
  - Client templates/brands like HAIROTICMEN remain intact as content.

The final result should feel like a clean, production-ready app branded as **IWRITE**, with professional naming and no leftover “HAIROTICMEN Writer” labels in the UI chrome.
