You are working on the IWRITE project.

PHASE 1 GOAL:
Do a **safe audit & cleanup** of the codebase so that:
- Routing is consistent (no random 404s on valid pages).
- Duplicate / dead pages and components are identified and removed or clearly marked.
- No business logic (auth/plans/admin/billing) is broken.

⚠️ DO NOT:
- Change API routes, DB schema, or environment variables.
- Change auth logic (login, JWT, cookies).
- Edit admin/plans/billing logic beyond minor bug fixes.
- Move QueryClientProvider.

You MAY:
- Reorganize client-side routes so each important page has exactly one definition.
- Remove clearly unused components/pages that are never imported anywhere.
- Fix imports, exports, and type errors that affect the UI.

TASKS:

1) ROUTING SURVEY
   - Open and analyze:
     - client/src/App.tsx
     - Any router config file (router.tsx etc.).
   - Build a list (internally) of all current routes and their components.
   - Ensure workspace routes exist for:
     - /dashboard, /ai-writer, /songwriter, /documents, /file-uploads,
       /templates, /style-profiles, /search, /topics, /archive, /settings, /admin
     - legal routes: /legal/imprint, /legal/privacy, /legal/terms, /legal/payment
   - Ensure there is a single NotFound/404 route used as catch-all.

2) DEAD CODE & DUPLICATES
   - Search for:
     - Pages/components never imported anywhere.
     - Old versions of the same page (e.g. OldDashboard.tsx).
   - For each obvious duplicate:
     - Keep the one that is actually used.
     - Delete the unused one OR mark it clearly as deprecated if you are not fully sure.
   - Keep changes minimal and safe.

3) LAYOUT CONSISTENCY
   - Make sure workspace pages use a common layout (sidebar + content + footer).
   - Public pages (Home, login) must NOT show the sidebar.

4) BUILD + VERIFY
   - Run `npm run build` and fix any UI-level errors caused by the cleanup.
   - Start dev server and check quickly:
     - /dashboard
     - /settings
     - /admin (for admin user)
     - legal pages
   - Confirm there are no new 404s for valid routes.

In your final summary, list:
- Files removed or renamed.
- Routing fixes.
- Any potential TODOs (things you were unsure about and left marked).
