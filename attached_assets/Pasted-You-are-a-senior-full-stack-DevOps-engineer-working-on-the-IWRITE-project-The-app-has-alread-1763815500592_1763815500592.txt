You are a senior full-stack + DevOps engineer working on the **IWRITE** project.

The app has already passed a major pre-production hardening phase with the following status:

✅ Already Implemented (Do NOT redo, just reuse/verify)
- Config Validation Layer (`server/config.ts`):
  - Validates required environment variables at startup.
  - Provides clear error messages when production env vars are missing.
  - Loads configuration from environment.

- Security Hardening (`server/index.ts` and related):
  - Request size limits (~10MB) to prevent DoS via large payloads.
  - CORS configuration (configurable via `CORS_ORIGIN` env var).
  - Graceful shutdown handling (`SIGTERM`).
  - Security headers and centralized error handling.

- Health Check Endpoint (`/healthz`):
  - Returns status, timestamp, and environment.
  - Startup logs show port and health check URL.

- Production Build:
  - `npm run build` completes successfully.
  - Server bundle (~92.8KB) and frontend bundle (~667KB) are generated.

⚠ What is STILL missing / needs attention:
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` exists but was not updated:
  - Needs a full, clear, up-to-date deployment guide.
- Final cross-check of ALL main flows in **production mode**.
- Extra validation: scan for TODO/FIXME, run types/tests if available, and document any remaining technical debt.

🎯 OVERALL GOAL
Take IWRITE from “95% production-ready” to a **fully documented, confidently deployable, production-ready application**.

You should:
1. Update and complete `DEPLOYMENT.md` with all necessary information.
2. Run a final, honest validation pass of the project.
3. Provide a precise summary of:
   - What you checked.
   - What you fixed/updated.
   - What remains as known limitations/technical debt.

🧩 STEP 1 — UPDATE `DEPLOYMENT.md`

Open the existing `DEPLOYMENT.md` and update/replace its content so it becomes the **single source of truth** for deploying IWRITE.

It MUST include at least:

1) **Overview**
   - Short description of IWRITE:
     - e.g., “IWRITE is an AI-powered, multi-language workspace for documents, templates, QA, topics, and songwriting.”

2) **Quick Start (Dev + Production)**  
   Example structure:

   - Requirements:
     - Node.js version (e.g. 18 or 20)
     - PostgreSQL (or compatible DB)
   - Development:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd IWRITE-
     npm install
     # create .env with required variables
     npm run migrate   # or the correct migration command
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Production:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo-url>
     cd IWRITE-
     npm install
     # create .env with required variables
     npm run migrate
     npm run build
     NODE_ENV=production npm run start
     ```

3) **Environment Variables Documentation**
   - List ALL required env vars:
     - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `CORS_ORIGIN`
     - Any others used by config validation.
   - For each:
     - What it is.
     - Example value.
     - Whether it is required or optional.

4) **Security Considerations & Authentication Warning**
   - Explicitly state:
     - There is NO authentication or user isolation yet.
     - The app is suitable for:
       - Internal use on a private network/VPN, OR
       - Environments with external auth/proxy in front.
   - Mention:
     - Request size limits.
     - CORS behavior.
     - Recommendation to run behind HTTPS and a reverse proxy (nginx, etc.).

5) **Deployment Scenarios / Hosting Recommendations**
   - At least one example for:
     - VPS (Ubuntu + Node + nginx + pm2)
     - A managed Node host (e.g. Render / Railway) — generic description is enough.
   - You can include:
     - Recommended process manager (pm2).
     - Recommended reverse proxy setup.

6) **Docker (Optional but Recommended)**
   - If feasible, include:
     - A basic `Dockerfile` or at least:
       - Suggested base image.
       - Commands: `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm run start`.
   - If a full Docker setup is too much now, add a “TODO: Docker support” section.

7) **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Common issues + fixes, for example:
     - Missing env vars → app fails at config validation.
     - DB connection errors → check `DATABASE_URL`, firewall, DB status.
     - CORS issues → misconfigured `CORS_ORIGIN`.
     - Build failing → Node version mismatch, missing dependencies.

8) **Known Limitations for v1**
   - No authentication.
   - PDF export is HTML only (users must print to PDF or use external conversion).
   - Keyword-based search instead of embeddings.
   - Any other limitations you know of.

Make sure `DEPLOYMENT.md` is clean, well structured, and easy to follow for someone who has never seen the project.

🧩 STEP 2 — EXTRA VALIDATION PASS

Now perform an **active search for missing or fragile areas**. This is critical.

1) Scan the codebase for:
   - `"TODO"`, `"FIXME"`, `"HACK"`, `"TEMP"`.
   - Commented-out blocks around:
     - AI calls
     - File uploads
     - Export logic
     - QA logic
   - For each meaningful item:
     - If it affects stability or production UX, either:
       - Fix it now, OR
       - List it explicitly as “Known Technical Debt” in your final summary (with file + a short description).

2) Run all available checks (if scripts exist in `package.json`):
   - Type checks:
     - e.g. `npm run lint` or `npm run typecheck` or `tsc --noEmit`.
   - Tests:
     - `npm test` if present.
   - Lint/format scripts (if defined).

   If any of these fail:
   - Fix what is realistically important for production.
   - If something is non-trivial to fix, document it under “Known Technical Debt”.

🧩 STEP 3 — FULL PRODUCTION SMOKE TEST

Run the app in **real production mode**:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
NODE_ENV=production npm run start
