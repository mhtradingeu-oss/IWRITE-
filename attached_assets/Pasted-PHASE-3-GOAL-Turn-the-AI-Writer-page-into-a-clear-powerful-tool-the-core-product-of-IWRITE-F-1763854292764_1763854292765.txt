PHASE 3 GOAL:
Turn the AI Writer page into a clear, powerful tool – the “core product” of IWRITE.

Focus on UI/UX and wiring to existing AI/document APIs. Do NOT change the AI engine itself.

TASKS:

1) SURVEY AI WRITER PAGE
   - Open `client/src/pages/AIWriter.tsx` (or equivalent).
   - Understand current props/controls:
     - Prompt field
     - Task presets (summarize, rewrite, etc.)
     - Document type, tone, language, length, etc.

2) LAYOUT & CONTENT
   - At the top of AI Writer page, add:
     - Title: “AI Writer”
     - Short description (EN/DE/AR via i18n):
       - Explain what this page does in 2–3 lines.
       - Example: “Create new professional documents from a prompt, rewrite existing drafts, and translate content in Arabic, German, and English.”

3) CORE ACTION: CREATE NEW DOCUMENT FROM PROMPT
   - Add a clear primary section:
     - Textarea for the prompt.
     - Selects for:
       - Document type (contract, policy, blog, product description, etc.)
       - Language (AR/EN/DE)
       - Tone (formal, friendly, technical, etc.)
       - Length (short/medium/long)
     - Button: “Generate New Document”.
   - On click:
     - Call the existing AI generation endpoint with all selected options.
     - After success:
       - Save the result as a new document via existing documents API.
       - Show success toast and either:
         - Open the document editor, OR
         - Show preview + “Open in Documents” button.

4) SECONDARY ACTIONS (REWRITE / TRANSLATE)
   - Keep existing presets (summarize, rewrite, translate) but:
     - Group them under a “Advanced tools” section with short descriptions.
     - Make sure each preset:
       - Has clear labels.
       - Shows which input is needed (e.g. “Paste existing text to rewrite”).

5) GUIDANCE & HELP
   - Add a small “Tips” card on the side:
     - Bullet points:
       - “Be specific about document type and audience.”
       - “You can reference uploaded files by their title.”
       - “Use AR / DE / EN language selector for multilingual content.”
     - Provide translations via i18n.

6) FREE vs PRO UI HINTS
   - For FREE users:
     - Show a small badge or banner on AI Writer:
       - “You are on FREE plan – X generations left today.”
   - For PRO users:
       - Badge: “PRO – unlimited daily generations”.

7) TEST
   - Generate a new document via prompt.
   - Confirm it appears in Documents page.
   - Ensure no crashes and that all texts are visible and understandable.

Summarize:
- What changed in AIWriter.tsx.
- How new document generation flow works (from prompt to saved document).
- How FREE/PRO hints are displayed.
